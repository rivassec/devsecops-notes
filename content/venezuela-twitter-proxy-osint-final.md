Summary: In 2012, I uncovered a state-aligned Twitter proxy tied to Venezuela’s ruling party. It mimicked Twitter, redirected traffic, and risked phishing user credentials. This post breaks down the OSINT methods I used to uncover it — and why threat intel teams still need to watch for subtle, state-run infrastructure.

## 🛰️ Situation

In the lead-up to Venezuela’s 2012 regional elections, I observed unusual behavior around Twitter access within the country. What began as anecdotal reports of DNS outages evolved into a deeper investigation that revealed a state-aligned proxy infrastructure potentially capable of phishing Twitter credentials.

---

## 🧠 Key Finding

A subdomain under `chavezcandanga.org.ve` — the official handle of then-President Hugo Chávez — was hosting a **transparent proxy to Twitter**.
A transparent proxy intercepts user traffic without modifying requests or requiring configuration, making it ideal for passive surveillance or phishing.

While it initially showed no malicious behavior, it was:

- Hosted on IP addresses **outside of Twitter’s ranges**
- Registered under infrastructure owned by the Venezuelan government (PSUV – *Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela*)
- Promoted through state-controlled media and bot accounts
- Served from the same IP as a political messaging app

## 🔎 OSINT Breakdown

### 1. ✅ DNS Resolution

```bash
host twitter.com
```

Returned expected Twitter IPs (199.59.x.x), but users in Venezuela were silently being redirected to:

```bash
190.202.80.20
```

This IP **served Twitter content** but was not operated by Twitter Inc.

It’s unclear whether this redirection was caused by ISP DNS override, local resolver poisoning, or upstream hijack — but the net effect was consistent: Twitter domains were silently redirected to non-Twitter infrastructure under state control.

### 2. ✅ WHOIS and Hosting Clues

```bash
whois chavezcandanga.org.ve
```

Revealed that the domain was registered to **PSUV** (*Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela*) and managed through CONATEL — Venezuela’s FCC-equivalent telecommunications regulator.

### 3. ✅ Application Infrastructure

The same server IP hosted:

- `mensajes.chavezcandanga.org.ve` – a campaign messaging platform
- A proxy script that mirrored Twitter’s login screen

At the time of discovery, this site **did not contain malicious code**, but the potential for **credential harvesting** during peak election activity was substantial. The authentication flow mimicked Twitter’s branding and prompted users to log in — creating a window for silent credential capture, token misuse, or targeted amplification based on follower behavior.

---

## 🔐 Threat Model & Implications

- **Credential Harvesting Risk**: Even without malware, a proxy to Twitter login enables password theft.
- **Social Media Control**: Through automated bots, the government amplified its message while monitoring access points.
- **Authentication-layer surveillance**: Intercepting Twitter logins enables password theft, identity tracking, or selective disinformation at the user level.
- **Infrastructure trust erosion**: Even minor state-level interference with DNS or TLS undermines confidence in web authentication across the board.
- **Evasion of International Scrutiny**: By mimicking Twitter directly, users could be deceived into trusting a controlled proxy.

---

## 🧰 Lessons for DevSecOps & Threat Intelligence Today

- **Verify SSL and domain trust chains** during high-risk periods like elections.
- Use `host`, `whois`, and passive DNS to correlate domains and IP ranges.
- Watch for **content delivery mismatches** (site appears normal, IP is not).
- Document and archive suspicious infra using tools like the Wayback Machine.
- Phishing infrastructure can be **state-sponsored and subtle** — early detection matters.

## 📅 Epilogue

The proxy remained active until at least December 2012, shortly before elections. To this day, the archived proxy content and WHOIS records serve as a warning about the ease with which social media can be co-opted in hostile environments.

This investigation was one of the earliest times I realized how fragile trusted infrastructure becomes in the hands of a motivated actor — and how critical open-source techniques are in defending it.
